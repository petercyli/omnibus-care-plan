The FHIR STU3 (Release 3) Omnibus Care Plan (OCP) Task profile uses FHIR resources and describes an activity that can be performed and tracks the state of completion of that activity. It is a representation that an activity should be or has been initiated, and eventually, represents the successful or unsuccessful completion of that activity. It identifies which core elements, extensions, and value sets SHALL be present in the resource when using this profile.

  <description value="This profile tracks the state of a task, enabling systems to ensure that tasks are completed. This information is kept separate from the operational details necessary to complete the task, as those details vary across and even within workflows. That detail is expected to be carried as the subject of the task. Tasks may have named inputs and outputs. Inputs represent information that may or must be present in order for a task to complete. Outputs represent intermediate or final results produced by a task. " />

      <definition value="A task to be performed. The Task resource defines several operations to enable rich control over the task execution environment. A server managing task resources may allow unfettered read access to all tasks that it maintains, but restrict write access to the task resources to itself in order to exert control over the task state machine. Instead, it might offer operations on tasks that enable strictly controlled write operations following commonly accepted business rules for task management. " />
      <comment value="For example, only tasks that are in the &quot;In Process&quot; state might be allowed to be &quot;Completed&quot; or &quot;Failed&quot;. Use or support of these operations is not essential in simple workflow environments where task activity needs little management. &#xD;&#xA;Tasks in any non-terminal state (Created, Ready, In Progress) can be suspended and resumed. When a task is suspended, it is typically resumed in the state it was in when it was originally suspended. Suspending a task suspends all of its children as well. Resuming a task resumes all of its children.&#xD;&#xA;An In-progress task can also be stopped, returning it to a Ready state. This may be in preparation for delegation or reassignment (e.g., because it cannot be completed by the current owner), to restart a task due to a temporary failure (e.g., to reattempt completion of the activity), or in preparation to allow others to claim the task." />

      <definition value="A task to be performed. The Task resource defines several operations to enable rich control over the task execution environment. A server managing task resources may allow unfettered read access to all tasks that it maintains, but restrict write access to the task resources to itself in order to exert control over the task state machine. Instead, it might offer operations on tasks that enable strictly controlled write operations following commonly accepted business rules for task management. " />
      <comment value="For example, only tasks that are in the &quot;In Process&quot; state might be allowed to be &quot;Completed&quot; or &quot;Failed&quot;. Use or support of these operations is not essential in simple workflow environments where task activity needs little management. &#xD;&#xA;Tasks in any non-terminal state (Created, Ready, In Progress) can be suspended and resumed. When a task is suspended, it is typically resumed in the state it was in when it was originally suspended. Suspending a task suspends all of its children as well. Resuming a task resumes all of its children.&#xD;&#xA;An In-progress task can also be stopped, returning it to a Ready state. This may be in preparation for delegation or reassignment (e.g., because it cannot be completed by the current owner), to restart a task due to a temporary failure (e.g., to reattempt completion of the activity), or in preparation to allow others to claim the task." />
